I needed a place for braindumps, since I need to free up some space inside my head. This is it; A very personal blog about nothing in particular. In Slovenian. [blebet.si](https://www.blebet.si)

Built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) & [Brevifolia](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/kendallstrautman/brevifolia-gatsby-forestry/) starter, deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and using [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics.
